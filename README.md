# Win32 PPlot
Win32 painter class for the [PPlot](http://pplot.sourceforge.net/) library.

PPlot is a portable lightweight C++ plotting library. The drawing of the actual plots depends on a concrete implementation of an abstract Painter class. This repository includes a painter class to draw plots in a pure Win32 C++ application and a small demo program.
